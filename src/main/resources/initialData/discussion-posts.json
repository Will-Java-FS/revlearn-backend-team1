    "content": "Data structures play a fundamental role in computer science and software engineering. Choosing the right data structure for a given application can significantly impact the performance and efficiency of an algorithm or system. For example, arrays provide quick access to elements but are limited in size, while linked lists allow dynamic memory allocation at the cost of slower access. Trees, on the other hand, are excellent for representing hierarchical data, while hash tables provide fast lookups for key-value pairs. Understanding these structures and their trade-offs is critical for optimizing applications."
