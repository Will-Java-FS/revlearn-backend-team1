    "title": "Advanced Data Structures: Trees and Graphs",
    "markdownContent": "## Introduction\nIn this lesson, we will dive deep into two critical data structures: trees and graphs.\n\n### Trees\nA tree is a hierarchical data structure where every node has a parent and child nodes, except for the root node, which has no parent. Trees are widely used in computer science for representing hierarchical structures like file systems and organizational charts.\n\n#### Types of Trees:\n- **Binary Trees**: Each node has at most two children.\n- **Binary Search Trees (BST)**: A binary tree where the left child is smaller than the parent, and the right child is greater.\n- **AVL Trees**: A self-balancing binary search tree where the heights of two child subtrees of any node differ by at most one.\n\n### Graphs\nGraphs consist of nodes (or vertices) connected by edges. Unlike trees, graphs can have cycles (circular paths).\n\n#### Types of Graphs:\n- **Directed Graphs**: Edges have directions, meaning they go from one vertex to another in a specific direction.\n- **Undirected Graphs**: Edges do not have directions, meaning the relationship between the vertices is mutual.\n- **Weighted Graphs**: Edges have weights or costs associated with them.\n\n### Use Cases\n- **Trees**: Used in databases (B-trees), artificial intelligence (decision trees), and file systems.\n- **Graphs**: Used in social networks, routing algorithms, and recommendation engines.\n\n### Traversal Techniques\n- **Tree Traversals**: Pre-order, In-order, and Post-order traversals are essential for visiting nodes in a specific order.\n- **Graph Traversals**: Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS) are widely used for exploring graphs.\n\n### Conclusion\nUnderstanding trees and graphs will help you design efficient algorithms for complex problems. Practice these structures to become proficient in solving real-world problems.",
    "instructorNotes": "Make sure students can differentiate between binary trees and graphs. Emphasize the use cases of each data structure, and spend extra time on graph traversal algorithms like DFS and BFS.",
